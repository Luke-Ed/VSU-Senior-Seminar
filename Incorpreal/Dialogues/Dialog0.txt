System,This is a test.,All the text written here is for test purposes. It's meant to be really long.,It's important to have long text to show how the tween animation speed works compared to input length.,It should also show that the dialogue box is scrollable. I have to have a lot of text to make the scroll bar show up. Here's a huge wall of text to demonstrate.,And this is the end of the demo. Thank you for watching.,Credit goes to Emilio and Afely on YouTube for their tutorials and their assets used for this component of the project.
