System,This is a test.,All the text written here is for test purposes. It's meant to be really long.,That's why there's so much text here. I know this is a lot of words for one little section.,It's important to have long text to show how the tween animation speed works compared to input length.,It should also show that the dialogue box is scrollable. I have to have a lot of text to make the scroll bar show up. Here's a huge wall of text to demonstrate exactly what I mean by this. See how long this text goes?,And this is the end of the demo.
